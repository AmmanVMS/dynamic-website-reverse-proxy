Feature: Create websites with redirects.
    Users should be able to create websites and edit them.

    Scenario Outline: We can create a website entry.
        Given we are <start>
         Then we type "<domain>" into the input for the domain
          And we type "<input source>" into the input for the source
         When we click "Save Website"
         Then we see a website for <website domain>
          And the website's domain is "<website domain>"
          And the website's source is "<website source>"
          And the website's owner is "<owner>"
