Feature: Edit already existing websites.
    Users should be able to edit websites they created and not those of other people.

    Scenario Outline: A user can not edit the website of another user.
        Given <other user>'s website <domain> is served by http://172.16.0.99
          And we are <start>
         Then we type "<domain>" into the input for the domain
          And we type "http://172.16.0.100" into the input for the source
         When we click "Save Website"
         Then we see a website for <domain>
          And the website's domain is "<domain>"
          And the website's source is "http://172.16.0.99"
          And the website's owner is "<other user>"
          And we see a website notice "<message>"

Examples: Anonymous edits the website
    | start             | domain            | other user | message                                             |
